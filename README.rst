Why
===

Utilities for loading and dumping database data as JSON.

These utilities (partially) replace Django's built-in ``dumpdata`` and
``loaddata`` management commands.

Suppose you want to move data between systems incrementally. In this case it
isn't sufficient to only know the data which has been created or updated; you
also want to know which data has been deleted in the meantime. Django's
``dumpdata`` and ``loaddata`` management commands only support the former case,
not the latter. They also do not including dependent objects in the dump.

This package offers utilities and management commands to address these
shortcomings.


How
===

``pip install feincms3-data``.

Add ``feincms3_data`` to ``INSTALLED_APPS`` so that the included management
commands are discovered.

Add specs somewhere describing the models and relationships you want to dump,
e.g. in a module named ``app.specs``:

.. code-block:: python

    from feincms3_data.data import (
        specs_for_app_models,
        specs_for_derived_models,
        specs_for_models,
    )
    from app.dashboard import models as dashboard_models
    from app.world import models as world_models


    def districts(args):
        pks = [int(arg) for arg in args.split(",") if arg]
        return [
            *specs_for_models(
                [world_models.District],
                {
                    "filter": {"pk__in": pks},
                    "delete_missing": True,
                },
            ),
            *specs_for_models(
                [world_models.Exercise],
                {
                    "filter": {"district__in": pks},
                    "delete_missing": True,
                },
            ),
            *specs_for_derived_models(
                world_models.ExercisePlugin,
                {
                    "filter": {"parent__district__in": pks},
                    "delete_missing": True,
                },
            ),
        ]


    def specs():
        return {
            "articles": lambda args: specs_for_app_models(
                "articles",
                {"delete_missing": True},
            ),
            "pages": lambda args: specs_for_app_models(
                "pages",
                {"delete_missing": True},
            ),
            "teachingmaterials": lambda args: specs_for_models(
                [
                    dashboard_models.TeachingMaterialGroup,
                    dashboard_models.TeachingMaterial,
                ],
                {"delete_missing": True},
            ),
            "districts": districts,
        }

Add a setting with the Python module path to the specs function:

.. code-block:: python

    FEINCMS3_DATA_SPECS = "app.specs.specs"


Now, to dump e.g. pages and teachingmaterials you would run::

    ./manage.py f3dumpdata pages teachingmaterials > tmp/dump.json

To dump the districts with the primary key of 42 and 43 you would run::

    ./manage.py f3dumpdata districts:42,43 > tmp/districts.json

The resulting JSON file has three top-level keys:

- ``"version": 1``: The version of the dump, because not versioning dumps is a
  recipe for pain down the road.
- ``"specs": [...]``: A list of model specs.
- ``"objects": [...]``: A list of model instances; uses the same serializer as
  Django's ``dumpdata``, everything looks the same.

Model specs consist of the following fields:

- ``"model"``: The lowercased label (``app_label.model_name``) of a model.
- ``"filter"``: A dictionary which can be passed to the ``.filter()`` queryset
  method as keyword arguments; used for determining the objects to dump and the
  objects to remove after loading.
- ``"delete_missing"``: This flag makes the loader delete all objects matching
  ``"filter"`` which do not exist in the dump.
- ``"ignore_missing_m2m"``: A list of field names where deletions of related
  models should be ignored when restoring. This may be especially useful when
  only transferring content partially between databases.
- ``"save_as_new"``: If present and truish, objects are inserted using new
  primary keys into the database instead of (potentially) overwriting
  pre-existing objects.

The dumps can be loaded back into the database by running::

    ./manage.py f3loaddata -v2 tmp/dump.json tmp/districts.json

Each dump is processed in an individual transaction. The data is first loaded
into the database; at the end, data *matching* the filters but whose primary
key wasn't contained in the dump is deleted from the database (if
``"delete_missing": True``).
